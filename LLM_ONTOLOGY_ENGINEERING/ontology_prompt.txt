Develop a comprehensive ontology for a military battlefield logistics decision support system that models entities, relationships, and decision-making factors in combat supply chain operations under battlefield conditions.

Define the following core classes. Location represents geographic nodes including main bases, forward depots, and combat unit positions with properties for node_id, node_name, geospatial coordinates, storage capacities for fuel, ammunition, food, water, and medical supplies, operational_status with values OPERATIONAL, DEGRADED, or DESTROYED, protection_level, and personnel_count. Route represents transportation network connections with properties for route_id, origin_node, destination_node, distance_km, travel_time_hours, route_status with values OPERATIONAL, DEGRADED, DAMAGED, or BLOCKED, threat_level, road_quality, and weather_impact. MilitaryUnit represents organizational entities with properties for unit_id, unit_type distinguishing logistics versus combat units, command_level for hierarchy, location_node, personnel_strength, combat_readiness, equipment_status, and resource dependencies for fuel and ammunition. Resource represents supplies with properties for resource_id, resource_type including fuel, ammunition, food, water, and medical, node_id for location, current_quantity, unit_measure, minimum_required threshold, consumption_rate_per_day, criticality_level, expiration_days, and resupply_priority. Vehicle represents transportation assets with properties for vehicle_id, vehicle_type including heavy trucks, light vehicles, and aircraft, current_location, capacity_kg, fuel_consumption_rate, operational_status, maintenance_required, crew_size, armor_level, and assigned_mission. Mission represents operational tasks with properties for mission_id, mission_type including resupply, emergency resupply, reconnaissance, and alternative supply, priority level, origin_node, destination_node, required_resources, assigned_vehicles, planned_route, status, start_time, estimated_completion_time, risk_level, and success_probability. Disruption represents incidents affecting operations with properties for disruption_id, disruption_type including facility destruction, route damage, infrastructure damage, weather impact, and resource depletion, affected_entity_type, affected_entity_id, severity, time_occurred, estimated_repair_time_hours, cause, cascading_effects, and mitigation_status. Event represents timeline occurrences with properties for event_id, event_type including attacks, infrastructure damage, weather events, resource alerts, mission events, and maintenance events, event_time, affected_entity_type, affected_entity_id, event_description, impact_severity, response_action, and resolution_time.

Define the following relationship types. CONNECTS_TO relates Location to Location with properties for route_id, distance, status, relationship_strength, and criticality. DEPENDS_ON relates Location to Route with dependency_level property. ALTERNATIVE_TO relates Route to Route with cost_difference and risk_difference properties. STORES relates Location to Resource with resource_type and quantity properties. SUPPLIES relates Location to Location with resource_flow and frequency properties. REQUIRES relates MilitaryUnit or Mission to Resource with resource_type and quantity or urgency properties. ASSIGNED_TO relates Vehicle to Mission with role and priority properties. ORIGINATES_FROM relates Mission to Location with departure_time property. DELIVERS_TO relates Mission to Location with arrival_time property. USES_ROUTE relates Mission to Route with sequence and planned_time properties. LOCATED_AT relates MilitaryUnit or Vehicle to Location with assignment_type and timestamp properties. AFFECTS relates Disruption to any entity with severity and impact properties. CASCADES_TO relates Disruption to Disruption with cascade_type property.

The ontology must support decision factors including temporal dynamics for resource consumption rates and time-sensitive mission windows, risk assessment for threat levels and success probabilities, priority management for criticality levels and mission hierarchies, capacity constraints for storage and vehicle limits, and operational status tracking. Provide query capabilities to find routes between locations, identify resource shortages, determine resupply schedules, assess disruption impacts, and calculate alternatives. Support reasoning to infer supply chain vulnerabilities, detect depletion risks, identify mission feasibility, predict disruption propagation, and recommend solutions. Enable temporal reasoning to track consumption over time and predict future states. Support spatial reasoning to calculate distances, optimize networks, and assess coverage.

Implement using OWL 2 DL organized into modules for spatial elements, resources, missions, organizational structure, and events. Design for scalability to handle hundreds of locations, thousands of vehicles, and tens of thousands of resource entries. Enable integration with GIS systems, logistics management systems, and mission planning tools. Include validation constraints for resource conservation, vehicle assignments, route feasibility, and temporal consistency.

The ontology must answer competency questions for resource management to identify shortages and predict depletion, route planning to find paths and calculate travel times, mission analysis to determine feasibility and success probability, disruption impact to assess cascading effects, risk assessment to identify vulnerabilities, and optimization to determine optimal assignments and distributions. The ontology should represent scenarios with multiple locations, units, resources, vehicles, routes, missions, disruptions, and events with their complex interdependencies to enable real-time replanning, resource optimization, and risk-aware mission planning in contested environments.
